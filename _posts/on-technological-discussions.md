On technological discussions

Technology waves come and go, in an ever-lasting and self-reinforcing eternal return.

Coupled with different shapes, bodies and ideas, the consequential and similarly perpetual schatological discussions never finds their path into quietly fading away.

Sketched and shepard by the historicity, ideology and biological inclinations of the technologist, the deeds of such heated and controversial conversations indefinetely are the same: unavailing platitudes.

In doing so, both sides filter and deceive themselves against the ontological properties of technology as of itself that would hitherto wound and distress the selfdom self-proclaimed professionals carefully crafted.

In the meanwhile, few and fortuitous engineers, aware of those feverish words or not, build and iterate, possessed by small yet brightful chunks of technic truth. And, in doing so, a small but further stage of technical evolution is reached.

There exists no possibility of discussion of a path, of a better solution, of an answer.

There only exists the recognition of technology, at its own ontology, existence, historicity. 

There is no willfull creation in this process. 

There is recognition, analysis, acknoledgment, remembrance, embracement. Choose a word.

As technology is never an object of oneself.

One is irrespectively the object of technology.
