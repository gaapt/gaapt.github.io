title: We want it boring
---


For most users, the Internet is filled with different cultures, races and nationalities. It seems like we overcame  geographical borders, replacing ideologies and ignorance  with reason and diversity.
 
We all know that's not true.

As the Internet expanded, its users, websites and discussions became increasingly more narrow-minded. The average user is exposed to a lot of self-reinforcing content. If you believe in X, you'll believe in X^n tomorrow.

###Enjoyment is all you need

Once, there was **the** guy that would change your mind.  First, his idea is ridiculous. Then, it kind of makes sense. Finally, there's relief and fondness for learning the truth.

The Web does the exact opposite of it. 

Both collaborative filtering (based on similarity with other users) and content-based filtering (based on historical activity of a single user) display the same ideas all the time. You buy/watch/share what you "enjoy" and the website makes a few cents. 

###What about different?

Different ideas are not "enjoyable". It takes effort to think by ourselves, so "new ideas" are mostly seen as a "threat" to websites making money off advertisement. 

Still, is that really true? Suggesting diverse content could produce longer user sessions and a better experience. It's worth a shot.

With a Risk-Aware Recommender System, like [DRARS](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01026136/document), users could be carefully exposed to new perspectives, spend more time learning about these and help websites make more money. Literally everybody wins.


###Unknown Path

As of 2015, users are hopelessly overwhelmed by the same content, wondering if there's any light at the end of the tunnel. Critical thinking has been replaced by ideological rants. Discussions are turned into barbaric jabbers. 

Still, the Web will find its way back into insightful users, communities and discussions. We can always fork it and make it better. It's just a matter of time.
