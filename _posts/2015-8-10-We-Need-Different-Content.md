title: We need different content
---


For most users, the Internet is filled with different cultures, races and nationalities. It seems as if we have overcome our geographical borders and replaced local ideologies,identities and ignorance  with global reason,freedom and diversity.
 
It doesn't take much to debunk such ludicrous idea.

In fact, as the Internet expanded, its users, websites and discussions became increasingly narrow-minded. The average user is exposed to a huge amount of self-reinforcing ideological content. Most are painstakingly trying to find different channels, content and ideas.

###Enjoyment is all you need

Once, there was **the** individual that would completely change your mind.  First, his idea seems ridiculous. Then, you diminish your ego and it partially makes sense. Ultimately, there's relief and fondness for understanding the truth.

The Web does the exact opposite of it. 

Recommender systems suggest what you 'enjoy' as much as possible. You buy/watch/share what  you 'enjoy' and the website makes a few cents. 

Both collaborative  filtering(based on similarity with other users) and content-based filtering(based on historical activity of a single user) have the same end: enjoy users.

###What about different?

In the end, different ideas are not 'enjoyable' at first glance. It takes too much effort to think by ourselves and such model is mostly seen as a  'threat' to those websites making money off advertisement. 

Still, it's unclear whether other business models couldn't outpace that business model. Suggesting diverse content could produce longer user sessions and avoid users to get bored. Shouldn't websites give it a shot? 

With a Risk-Aware Recommender System, like [DRARS](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01026136/document), users could carefully be exposed to different perspectives, spend more time learning about these and, consequently, help websites make more money. Literally everybody wins.


###Unknown Path

However, as of 2015, it has never been so easy to start an online cult and become a messiah. Critical thinking has been replaced by ideological rants. Discussions were turn into barbaric jabbers. Users are hopelessly overwhelmed by the same content, wondering if there's any light at the end of the tunnel.

Still, I like to believe technology will find its way back into fruitful communities and discussions. Business models serve users, not the other way around. We can still fork it and make it better. Hopefully, it's just a matter of time.
