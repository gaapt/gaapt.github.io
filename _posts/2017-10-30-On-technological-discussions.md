title: On technological discussions
---

Technology battles and debates come and go, in an ever-lasting and self-reinforcing eternal return.

Future of X. Why Y is the best. Why Z is the worst.

Coupled with different shapes, bodies and ideas, the consequential and similarly perpetual eschatological discussions never find their path into silently fading away.

Sketched and shepard by the historicity, ideology and biological inclinations of the technologist, the deeds of such heated and controversial conversations indefinetely are the same: unavailing platitudes.

In doing so, both sides filter and deceive themselves against the ontological properties of technology as of itself that would hitherto wound and distress the selfdom self-proclaimed professionals carefully crafted.

In the meanwhile, few and fortuitous engineers, aware of those feverish words or not, build and iterate, possessed by small yet brightful chunks of technic truth. And, in doing so, a small but further stage of technical evolution is reached.

There exists no possibility of discussion of a path, of a better solution, of an answer to questions from a clearly distinct and distant phenomenology. At its level, technical development, situates the intrinsic causality of matter for the sole extension of human capacity, independent from aesthetics, financial arbitrage, or any other fabricated purpose. 

There only exists the recognition of technology, at its own ontology, existence, historicity. 

There is analysis, acknoledgment, remembrance, embracement.

Yet, there is no willfull strings or spades capable of forcing a given direction the autonomous and behemothic vehicle that rides itself.

And as such, technology is never an object of oneself.

One is irrespectively the object of technology.
