title: Silly contributions
---



For 2 months,  I hadn't contributed to open source projects. There was a part of me saying I had to do something, but whatever the idea, I'd purge myself believing it was 'too small or irrelevant' to spend my time with.

But, all of a sudden,  I thought it would be nice to start a blog.  I mean,  why not? Jekyll seems pretty nice. _It's just gonna take a minute._

**Done.**

Then, while typing my first post on LibreOffice,  I didn't have Lato( my all time favorite font). I googled the process of installing a Google Font on Ubuntu and it took me ~15 minutes to set everything up. 

Still,  how cool would it be to [install fonts with just one command](https://github.com/gaapt/clifont/)? 

I couldn't find anything on Github. Even if it existed, _it's just gonna take a minute._

**Done.**

Back to LibreOffice, my essay was too vague and bold for a first post. I discard it. But, why not talk about how I got here? _It's just gonna take a minute._

**Done.**

Now, I don't know what happens after this. I could forget about Github like last time.  I could start a really cool repository. I could undermine my career because of silly side-projects. I could write cool posts.  Whatever the outcome, it started by forking a silly Jekyll blog. 

**Done.**
